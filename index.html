                            were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. manned spaceflights.<br>
                            Johnson's work included calculating trajectories, launch windows and emergency return paths for 
                            Project Mercury spaceflights, including those of astronauts Alan Shepard, the first American in space, 
                            and John Glenn, the first American in orbit, and rendezvous paths for the Apollo lunar lander and 
                            command module on flights to the Moon.<br>

                <article id="tribute-info" class="small-width">
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fact-li">Katherine Johnson was born in 1918 in West Virginia. She was the youngest of four children. 
                            She showed strong mathematical abilities from an early age.<br>
                            Because their County did not offer public schooling for African-American students past the eighth grade, the Colemans 
                            arranged for their children to attend high school in Institute, West Virginia.<br>
                            Johnson was enrolled when she was only 10 years old.</li>
                        <li class="fact-li">Johnson graduated from high school at 14 and entered West Virginia State.<br>
                            As a student, she took every math course offered by the college, and graduated summa cum laude in 1937, at age 18, 
                            with degrees in mathematics and French.<br>
                            She took on a teaching job at a black public school in Marion, Virginia.</li>
                        <li class="fact-li">In 1953, she became part of the early NASA team.</li>
                        <li class="fact-li">From 1958 until her retirement in 1986, Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist, moving during her career to the Spacecraft Controls Branch.</li>
                        <li class="fact-li">In 1961, she calculated the trajectory for the space flight of Alan Shepard, the first American in space. 
                            She also calculated the launch window for his 1961 Mercury mission.<br>
                            She plotted backup navigation charts for astronauts in case of electronic failures.<br>
                            Also in 1961, her work helped to ensure 
                            that Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 Mercury capsule would be quickly found after landing, using the accurate trajectory that had 
                            been established.</li>
                        <li  class="fact-li">In 1969, she helped to calculate the trajectory for the Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.</li>
                        <li class="fact-li">In 1970, Johnson worked on the Apollo 13 moon mission. When the mission was aborted, her work on backup procedures and 
                            charts helped set a safe path for the crew's return to Earth, creating a one-star observation system that would allow astronauts 
                            to determine their location with accuracy.</li>
                        <li class="fact-li">Later in her career, Johnson worked on the Space Shuttle program, the Earth Resources Satellite, 
                            and on plans for a mission to Mars.</li>
                        <li class="fact-li">In 2015, President Barack Obama presented Johnson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</li>

                            <p>"Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Who Helped Win the Space Race" 
                                is a 2016 non-fiction book written by Margot Lee Shetterly.<br>
                                Hidden Figures tells the story of three African-American women who worked as computers to 
                                solve problems for engineers and others at NASA. For the first years of their careers, 
                                the workplace was segregated and women were kept in the background as human computers.<br>
                                The book explains how these three historical women overcame discrimination and racial segregation 
                                to become three American achievers in mathematics, scientific and engineering history.<br>
                                The main character, Katherine Johnson, calculated rocket trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions.<br>

                            <p>"Hidden Figures" is a 2016 American biographical drama film loosely based on the non-fiction book 
                                of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly about black female mathematicians who worked at the National Aeronautics and 
                                Space Administration (NASA) during the Space Race.<br>
                                The film stars Taraji P. Henson as Katherine Johnson, a mathematician who calculated flight trajectories for Project Mercury 
                                and other missions. The film also features Octavia Spencer as NASA supervisor and mathematician Dorothy Vaughan and 
                                Janelle Monáe as NASA engineer Mary Jackson.<br>
                                The film received positive reviews from critics. It was chosen by National Board of Review as one of the top ten films 
                                of 2016 and was nominated for numerous awards, including three Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and 
                                Best Supporting Actress for Spencer), and two Golden Globes (Best Supporting Actress for Spencer and Best Original Score).
