## The project

### What this project does

##### Project original Users stories:

1. My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements
1. I should see an element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
1. I should see a `div` element with a corresponding `id="img-div"`
1. Within the `img-div` element, I should see an img element with a corresponding `id="image"`
1. Within the `img-div` element, I should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`
1. I should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
1. I should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. `target="_blank"`)
1. The `img` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
1. The `img` element should be centered within its parent element
